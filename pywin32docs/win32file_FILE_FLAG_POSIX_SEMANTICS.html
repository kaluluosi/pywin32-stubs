<B>const win32file.FILE_FLAG_POSIX_SEMANTICS;</B><P>

Indicates that the file is to be accessed according to POSIX rules. 

This includes allowing multiple files with names, differing only in case, for file systems that support such naming. 

Use care when using this option because files created with this flag may not be accessible by applications written for MS-DOS or Windows.<P>

<B>const win32security.LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE;</B><P>

This logon type is intended for users who will be interactively using the machine, such as a user being logged on by a terminal server, remote shell, or similar process. This logon type has the additional expense of caching logon information for disconnected operation, and is therefore inappropriate for some client/server applications, such as a mail server.<P>

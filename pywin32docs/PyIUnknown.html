Note that there are no reference counting functions that are typically exposed via COM. 

This is because COM reference counts are automatically handled by PythonCOM - each interface 

object keeps exactly one COM reference, regardless of how many Python references.  When the 

Python object destructs due to its reference count hitting zero, the COM reference is then 

released.  It is not possible for force the closure of a PythonCOM object - the only 

way to ensure cleanup is to remove all Python references.<P>

<B>const win32process.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP;</B><P>

The new process is the root process of a new process group. The process group includes all processes that are descendants of this root process. The process identifier of the new process group is the same as the process identifier, which is returned in the lpProcessInformation parameter. Process groups are used by the GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent function to enable sending a ctrl+c or ctrl+break signal to a group of console processes.<P>

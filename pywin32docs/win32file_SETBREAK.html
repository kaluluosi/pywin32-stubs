<H1>SETBREAK</H1>

<B>const win32file.SETBREAK;</B><P>

Suspends character transmission and places the transmission line in a break state until the ClearCommBreak function is called (or EscapeCommFunction is called with the CLRBREAK extended function code). The SETBREAK extended function code is identical to the SetCommBreak function. Note that this extended function does not flush data that has not been transmitted.<P>

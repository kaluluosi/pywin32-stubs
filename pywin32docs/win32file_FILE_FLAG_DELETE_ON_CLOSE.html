<B>const win32file.FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE;</B><P>

Indicates that the operating system is to delete the file immediately after all of its handles have been closed, 

not just the handle for which you specified FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE. Subsequent open requests for the file will fail, unless FILE_SHARE_DELETE is used.<P>

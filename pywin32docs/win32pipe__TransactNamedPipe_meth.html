<H3>Parameters</H3><P><DT><I>pipeName</I> : <A HREF="PyUNICODE.html">PyUNICODE</A><P>

<DD>The name of the pipe.<P><DT><I>writeData</I> : string/buffer<P>

<DD>The data to write to the pipe.<P><DT><I>buffer/bufSize</I> : <A HREF="PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer.html">PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer</A>/int<P>

<DD>Size of the buffer to create for the result, 

or a buffer to fill with the result. If a buffer object and overlapped is passed, the result is 

the buffer itself.  If a buffer but no overlapped is passed, the result is a new string object, 

built from the buffer, but with a length that reflects the data actually read.<P><DT><I>overlapped=None</I> : <A HREF="PyOVERLAPPED.html">PyOVERLAPPED</A><P>

<DD>An overlapped structure or None<P>

<H3>Comments</H3>

This function is modelled on <A HREF="win32file__ReadFile_meth.html">win32file::ReadFile</A> - for overlapped 

operations you are expected to provide a buffer which will be filled 

asynchronously.<P>

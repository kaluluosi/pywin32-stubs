<HR><H1>PyOVERLAPPEDReadBuffer Object</H1><P>

An alias for a standard Python buffer object. 

Previous versions of the Windows extensions had a custom object for 

holding a read buffer.  This has been replaced with the standard Python buffer object. 

<BR>Python does not provide a method for creating a read-write buffer 

of arbitary size, so currently this can only be created by <A HREF="win32file__AllocateReadBuffer_meth.html">win32file::AllocateReadBuffer</A>.<P>

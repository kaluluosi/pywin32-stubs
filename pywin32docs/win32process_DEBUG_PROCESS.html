<H1>DEBUG_PROCESS</H1>

<B>const win32process.DEBUG_PROCESS;</B><P>

If this flag is set, the calling process is treated as a debugger, and the new process is a process being debugged. The system notifies the debugger of all debug events that occur in the process being debugged. 

If you create a process with this flag set, only the calling thread (the thread that called CreateProcess) can call the WaitForDebugEvent function. 

Windows 95 and Windows 98: This flag is not valid if the new process is a 16-bit application.<P>
